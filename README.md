# Building-a-CNN-network-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow-and-tune-hyperparameters
This code uses the fashion-mnist image data set to build a Convolutional Neural Network. This code also includes image visualization, Data preprocessing, and tuning various hyper parameters to see if the model performs better. 
The Code follows the following order:  
1.Loading the dataset  
2.Data visualizations
3.Reshaping the dataset to build a CNN over it
4.Train test split 
5.Building a Convolutional Neural Network. 

The tuning hyper parameters executed are as follows:
1.Adding early stopping 
2.Adding regularizations 
3.Batch Normalization 
4.Performing K-fold cross validation

5.Modelling it with different Kernel Initializers
6.Modelling it with different Activation Functions
7.Changing the Drop out value 

Lastly, we increase the imageset using data augmentation techniques and fit the same model over it to see if the model performs better
