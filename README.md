# Building-a-CNN-network-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow-and-tune-hyperparameters
This code uses the income data set to predict whether a given data point has an income below or above $50k. This code also includes data visualization, Data preprocessing, and tuning various hyper parameters to see if the model performs better. The Code follows the following order:  Loading the dataset Statistical information retrieved from the dataset Data visualizations Data Pre processing. (Normalization, One hot encoding, handling missing/corrupted values and outliers) Train test split Building a Neural Network. The tuning hyper parameters executed are as follows:  Modelling it with different activation functions Changing the Drop out value Modelling the optimizer Adding early stopping Adding regularizations Defining a gradient clipping Performing K-fold cross validation
